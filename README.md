# T3 Gallery

T3 Gallery is a modern, full-stack image gallery application built with the T3 Stack and other cutting-edge technologies. This project serves as a portfolio piece to showcase a robust, production-ready application with a focus on performance, user experience, and a sleek, neon purple aesthetic.

Users can sign in, and authorized users can upload images to a shared gallery. The application features a modal view for images, which also generates a unique, shareable URL for each image. This project was inspired by Theo's "From 0 to Production" tutorial, but has been extended with unique features and a custom design.
